# decoderproject
 In this project, a neural decoder is developed which takes time series of brain signals and predicts time series of electromyographic signals of different muscles. This is achieved by building a LSTM decoder for offline decoding, and a basic RNN for mimicking an online decoder.
 
 The code can be run either by
 - running the main.ipynb in the notebooks folder, or by
 - running the main.py file in the src folder

main.py is pure code, whereas main.ipynb contains explanations and a storyline.
